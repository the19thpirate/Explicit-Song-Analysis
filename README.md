### Idea behind the project:

- In 1985, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, Dee Snider had been summoned by the American Congress because the Parents Music Resource Center had singled them and a few other
artists for **for ostensibly making obscene music**.

- To understand thoroughly what happened on that day this video by Weird history can be seen on Youtube the link is as follows:

[Weird History : How Twisted Sister Outclassed the Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OceijOEVqU&ab_channel=WeirdHistory)


### Points Taken from the Video:
- One section of the video wherein Mr. Dee talks about how to introduce music to children was very interesting and to this date is not being followed by many parents.
- This might be due to lack of attention by the parents towards the children due to their own demanding jobs etc.

- The points that Mr. Dee mentions are as follows:
  - 1. Check the Band Name : Is it anything explicit.
  - 2. See the song names in the back of the album cover
  - 3. Listen to all the songs in the album before introducing it to their children. 

- The advocate Tipper Gore made accusations that their song Under the Blade had sadomasochistic ideas present in their song. To prove that wrong, the artist himself explained 
what the song was about and how Tipper Gore had interpreted it differently. 
- When the song lyrics were analyzed through this application the following results could be seen:

![Subjectivity, Polarity](https://github.com/the19thpirate/Explicit-Song-Analysis/blob/main/Sub%2Cpol%2Cverdict.JPG)

#### Insight:
  - Ofcourse, the song cannot be just recommended directly to a younger audience.
  - The 2% polarity of the song suggests that it is very Neutral.
  - As a songwriter myself, there has to be a balance between subjectivity and objectivity.
    - A song which is highly subjective delivers a biased idea which is not healthy for the mind.
  - The Subjectivity score for this song is 51% which suggests a balance which is **really great**.
